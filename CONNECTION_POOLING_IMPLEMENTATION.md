## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Drop-in Replacement)

```python
# Before (direct connections)
with IronChefDatabaseSecure() as db:
    db.cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM episodes")
    results = db.cursor.fetchall()

# After (pooled connections - same code!)
with IronChefDatabasePooled() as db:
    db.cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM episodes")
    results = db.cursor.fetchall()
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from connection_pool import PoolConfig
from iron_chef_database_pooled import create_pooled_database

# Custom pool configuration
config = PoolConfig(
    min_connections=5,
    max_connections=20,
    connection_timeout=60.0,
    health_check_interval=600.0
)

# Create pooled database with custom config
db = create_pooled_database("iron_chef_japan.db", config)
```

### Monitoring Integration

```python
from pool_monitor import initialize_global_monitor, get_global_monitor

# Initialize monitoring
monitor = initialize_global_monitor(
    collection_interval=5.0,
    enable_alerts=True
)

# Get performance metrics
metrics = monitor.get_current_metrics()
health = monitor.get_health_status()
alerts = monitor.get_active_alerts()
```

## 🚨 Operational Considerations

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Pool Sizing**: Start with 5-15 connections, adjust based on load
2. **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. **Health Checks**: Configure appropriate validation intervals
4. **Timeouts**: Set reasonable connection and validation timeouts
5. **Cleanup**: Ensure graceful shutdown procedures are in place

### Performance Tuning

Key tuning parameters:

- **Pool Size**: Balance between resource usage and performance
- **Connection Timeout**: Prevent long waits during high load
- **Health Check Interval**: Balance between reliability and overhead
- **SQLite Settings**: Optimize WAL mode and cache settings

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Pool Exhaustion**: Increase max_connections or reduce timeout
2. **High Latency**: Check connection validation timeout
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for connection leaks
4. **Startup Issues**: Verify database path and permissions
